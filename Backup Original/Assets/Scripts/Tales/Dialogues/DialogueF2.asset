  - 'Your abilities will only activate if you have a power greater than the opponent''s
    power.

    Allow me to teach you how you can increase your power.

'
  - 'Each of your skills has a level that is represented by this symbol:'
  - Each character has an amount of mana that you can spend on each fight.
  - 'Your power will be equal to the level of your skill multiplied by the mana you
    use. '
  - The more mana you spend, the more chance you have to activate your skills, but
    the less mana you will have in the next turns
  - This means that the best move is to get a higher power than the opponent by spending
    the least amount of mana possible.
