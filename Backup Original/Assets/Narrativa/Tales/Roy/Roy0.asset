  Dialogue:
  - Your name is <color=blue>Roy Ulbricht</color>, your duty is to keep the peace,
    your duty is to protect the weak, your duty is to fight for the nation, your
    duty is to make money.
  - '<color=blue>Roy</color> was finding it increasingly difficult to get up from
    his bed because he was getting thinner every day.

    Snow couldn''t feed his
    body made of water, just as a lie couldn''t feed his soul made of illusions.'
  - 'One more time.

    Your name is <color=blue>Roy Ulbricht</color>, your duty
    is to keep the peace, your duty is to protect the weak, your duty is to fight
    for the nation, your duty is to make money.'
  - After getting up, like every good citizen of <color=green>Sarka</color>, he went
    to work. But <color=blue>Roy</color> was no ordinary man, he had the noblest
    of jobs, he was a soldier of the <color=red>Blue Guard</color>.
  - Upon arriving at the barracks, he found his superior, <color=yellow>Yuri Vitchi</color>,
    a leader admired for his courage and effort. He was about to announce the task
    that would allow Roy to keep the peace, protect the weak, fight for the nation,
    and make money.
  - Their mission would be to face <color=green>Sarka</color>'s vilest creatures,
    the regicidal cannibals who lived in <color=purple>Denai</color>.
