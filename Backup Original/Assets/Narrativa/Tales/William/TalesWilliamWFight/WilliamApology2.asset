  Dialogue:
  - "The third pillar\u2026"
  - William already imagined that that bard would argue against the arrest and say
    something about freedom of speech.
  - Be quiet, nothing you say can prevent you from being arrested.
  - "Kuvira's third pillar\u2026 freedom of speech."
  - William thought how predictable that bard was, he didn't even understand that
    he was being arrested for raising his daggers against a warrior and not for the
    music he played.
  - You bards are too cowardly to commit crimes into your own hands, but your music
    constantly encourages people to break the law. Kuvira always made it very clear
    that apology for crime would never be allowed.
  - We are free only to agree with the law.
  - The bard began to laugh.
  - Why are you laughing? You lost.
  - I lost a fight, but I won where it matters. I won in being happier, because while
    you decided to be a slave to the law, I decided to be a slave to my passions.
    Even if I die now, I will be satisfied that I lived my life to the fullest.
  - Are you happier than me?
  - William reduced the bard's happiness.
  - And now?
  - I'm sorry.
  - William reduced the bard's happiness.
  - Please! Stop... please.
  - Are you even happier than I am?
  - Please! Stop... please.
  - No... No!
  - That bard started having trouble breathing.
  - "You're more\u2026happy\u2026than I am."
  - William's happiness increased.
