  Dialogue:
  - <color=purple>William</color> began to feel afraid, his job was simple, he just
    needed to arrest <color=green>Vlad Burarth</color>, a bourgeois guilty of tax
    evasion.
  - 'That bourgeois was weak, offered no resistance to arrest, and followed <color=purple>William</color>''s
    orders without hesitation. He disobeyed only one order:'
  - Say something.
  - Silence.
  - That silence was terrifying.
  - Why are you smiling? Answer me!
  - Silence.
  - <color=purple>William</color> tried to ignore it, but it was difficult, he had
    never met someone so calm and with such an air of superiority.
  - His smile of pure satisfaction was frightening.
  - I know why you're smiling, you're going to hire an assassin to kill me, be silent
    if my hypothesis is correct.
  - 'This time he managed to wrest an answer from the <color=green>bourgeois</color>:'
  - I would never do that.
  - Five days later an assassin was in front of him.
  DialogueBR:
  - "<color=purple>William</color> come\xE7ou a sentir medo, seu trabalho era simples,
    ele s\xF3 precisava prender <color=green>Vlad Burarth</color>, um burgu\xEAs
    acusado de sonega\xE7\xE3o fiscal."
  - "Aquele burgu\xEAs era fraco, n\xE3o ofereceu resist\xEAncia \xE0 pris\xE3o e
    seguiu as ordens de <color=purple>William</color> sem hesita\xE7\xE3o. Ele desobedeceu
    apenas uma ordem:"
  - Diga algo.
  - "Sil\xEAncio."
  - "Aquele sil\xEAncio era aterrorizante."
  - "Por que voc\xEA est\xE1 sorrindo? Responda-me!"
  - "Sil\xEAncio."
  - "<color=purple>William</color> tentou ignor\xE1-lo, mas era dif\xEDcil, ele nunca
    tinha conhecido algu\xE9m t\xE3o calmo e com tanto ar de superioridade."
  - "Seu sorriso de pura satisfa\xE7\xE3o era assustador."
  - "Eu sei porque voc\xEA est\xE1 sorrindo, voc\xEA vai contratar um assassino para
    me matar, fique em sil\xEAncio se minha hip\xF3tese estiver correta."
  - "Desta vez ele conseguiu arrancar uma resposta do <color=green>burgu\xEAs</color>:"
  - Eu nunca faria isso.
  - Cinco dias depois, um assassino estava diante dele.
