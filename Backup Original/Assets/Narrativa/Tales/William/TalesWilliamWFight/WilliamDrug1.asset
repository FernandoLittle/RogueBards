  Dialogue:
  - 'William liked the nights just as he liked the solitude. He was resting sitting
    on a bench in a silent square, until his moment of peace was destroyed by a drug
    dealer who asked:'
  - Do you want opium?
  - Do you have shit in your head or what? Can't you recognize a warrior when you
    see one?
  - The dealer never felt so stupid and never got so scared, he apologized and tried
    to run, but Willian grabbed his arm.
  - Don't worry, I won't arrest you or hurt you, but you have to tell me where the
    guy who hired you is.
  - The drug dealer felt stupid once again, he had no reason to be afraid, that warrior
    would never hurt him.
  - The guy who hired me? He's fucking his mother, that bitch.
  - 'William took a deep breath:'
  - I'll ask again, please answer me, who hired you?
  - It is not obvious? Your father hired me, but you mustn't know him, he's a bard
    with a half-meter dick.
  - William was silent, looking at the dealer for a long, unpleasant time.
  - I don't usually lie, so heed my warning, it's in your best interest to answer
    this question, who hired you and where is he?
  - Fuck you.
  - The drug dealer felt like an idiot once again, that warrior was indeed capable
    of hurting him. The punch was so strong that he lost a tooth. Fortunately, this
    was not a very serious problem, as a new tooth was already growing to replace
    the old one.
  - 'After holding the drug dealer by the mouth, William said:'
  - Is it in your best interest to stop crying and answer me, who hired you and where
    is he?
  - The dealer lied, giving the name and address of a killer he knew. Willian naively
    believed and, the next day, he was faced with an opponent much stronger than
    he imagined.
