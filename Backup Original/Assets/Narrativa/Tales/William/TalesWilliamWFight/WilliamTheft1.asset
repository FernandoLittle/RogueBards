  Dialogue:
  - One of Sarka's banks received information that revealed that he would be the
    target of a major robbery. The warriors' mission was to set an ambush inside
    the bank and capture the thieves.
  - As he prepared for the ambush, William was surprised by the presence of several
    warriors he had never seen. According to Captain Parovy they were warriors from
    another district. William felt a little sorry for their district. for when the
    fight between warriors and thieves began it was evident that the warriors in
    the other district were cowards who avoided fighting as much as possible.
