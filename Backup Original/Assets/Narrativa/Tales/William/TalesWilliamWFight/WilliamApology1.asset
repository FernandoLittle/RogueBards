  Dialogue:
  - Warriors used to hate Sarka's bards, William only began to understand this hatred
    when he heard a terrible song about how criminals were smart.
  - About how the followers of the law were fools.
  - About how the criminals were happy.
  - About how the followers of the law were  sad.
  - About how criminals were free.
  - About how followers of the law were slaves.
  - The music made a bit of sense, a criminal was able to enjoy the perks of crime,
    while a follower of the law one was not. But everything that bard said in his
    song would be reversed the moment the criminal was caught.
  - William figured that bard would learn this important lesson when he was arrested.
