  Dialogue:
  - William, you really want to go on this mission, you're going to put doctors in
    prison, that's dangerous.
  - More dangerous than our daily work?
  - Yes. Doctors are rich and the sale of organs is a crime protected by the assassins'
    guild. That means the assassins will come to you.
  - These doctors are enriching themselves with our colleagues' organs, you saw what
    Kain said about the investigations, Marlov was held captive for months only to
    be quartered and had his organs implanted into corrupt aristocrats.
  - "Marlov was a friend of mine for years, every month we had dinner together. I
    thank you for avenging him, William. But take care, every good warrior ends up
    getting a bounty on his head. A big bounty means assassins chasing you and\u2026"
  - And what?
  - And you are a very good warrior, be careful.
  - William's mission was very successful and three surgeons linked to organ trafficking
    were arrested. But Parov's prediction was correct, an assassin came to cut off
    William's head.
