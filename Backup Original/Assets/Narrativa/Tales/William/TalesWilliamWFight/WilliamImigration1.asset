  Dialogue:
  - Fuck where he was born, I've got better things to do than kick him out of the
    country.
  - You are unpatriotic.
  - Yes I am. Believe what you want, the door is there, buddy.
  - 'Just after Otterg opened the door, William shouted:'
  - Hang on!
  - You lied to me, didn't you?
  - What? I didn't lie, I swear he's an illegal immigrant.
  - ' Not on that part. Your name is Otterg Sasmark, you clearly come from a Serician
    immigrant family, by the way, my grandfather also came from Sericia. In any case,
    it makes no sense for you to hate immigrants to the point of wanting to expel
    them if you are recently related to immigrants. Is there another reason behind
    your order, am I wrong?'
  - "The real reason is\u2026 my wife cheated on me with that man."
  - Hm, so you're cuckold, it's a good reason and you had the guts to reveal it,
    which is admirable.
  - I'll help you then, adulterer has to fuck himself.
