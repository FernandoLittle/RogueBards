  Dialogue:
  - The following week Captain Parovy was furious.
  - "William, you\u2026."
  - He took a deep breath and lowered his voice.
  - Is it true that you refused a bribe from a betting house and arrested the attendant?
  - Yes.
  - Why the hell didn't you take the fucking bribe?
  - Because that would be against the law.
  - Parovy was having trouble controlling himself.
  - William, is your salary good?
  - ye...
  - No! It is not. The salary of all warriors sucks because we risked our damn lives
    and there's no money to pay for it.
  - The betting houses are our extra income and there's no reason to refuse the damn
    bribes. Nobody gains anything from it.
  - Capta...
  - Nobody!
  - "Captain! It is not our duty to legislate, we just follow the\u2026"
  - Silence! You've given me a huge amount of work these days, luckily I managed
    to negotiate with the betting houses, they'll ignore the shit you did as long
    as I release the guy you arrested and fire you.
  - William wasn't going to beg for forgiveness, he just looked at him with contempt
    in his eyes, hoping that would upset Parovy.
  - It may not seem like it, William, but this is for your own good, otherwise the
    betting houses would hire an assassin to kill you.
