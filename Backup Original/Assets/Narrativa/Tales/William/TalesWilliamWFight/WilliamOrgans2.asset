  Dialogue:
  - How many warriors did you kill? How many of my friends did you quarter to sell
    organs?
  - Four.
  - William kicked him.
  - That's all you have to say, "four?", are we a number for you?
  - You don't want to hear me, you just want to see me suffer.
  - Wrong, I want to hear you and make you suffer. Let's play a game, the better
    your arguments are, the less painful your death will be.
  - The assassin thought, took his dagger and tried to use his last strength to kill
    himself. But before he could commit suicide, William kicked him and took his
    dagger.
  - Your life and death are mine. You assassins don't like to speak up and justify
    your side? Don't you always have a damned argument to defend your atrocities?
  - The assassin thought for a while and tried to formulate the best possible argument
    to defend himself.
  - Assassins kill warriors, warriors kill assassins. But when you warriors condemn
    someone to death, refuse to sell their organs, that would be inhumane and you
    are too benevolent to treat people as objects.
  - 'You respect the corpses of even the vilest murderers.

    But we assassins
    are different, we don''t respect traditions, we don''t respect corpses, we don''t
    respect morals, we only fight for money because we''re bad.'
  - And our wickedness saved the lives of the many people who bought our organs.
  - In his last moments, the assassin felt like the worst arguer in the world when
    he remembered the phrase "the better your arguments are, the less painful your
    death will be".
