  - It was easy to recognize a betting house, even if it didn't have any signs, as
    practically every establishment with no name and a curtain to prevent its interior
    from being seen by outsiders was a betting house in Sarka.
  - The attendant quickly realized that William was a warrior.
  - You came early this month, here's the pay.
  - William gave him a menacing look.
  - Are you trying to bribe me? You will be arrested.
  - Calm, calm, calm, you don't need so much hostility, I can increase the pay, so
    everyone is happy, right?
  - "Foi bom fazer neg\xF3cio com voc\xEA."
