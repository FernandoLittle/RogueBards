  Dialogue:
  - The following week <color=yellow>Captain Parovy</color> was furious.
  - "<color=purple>William</color>, you\u2026."
  - He took a deep breath and lowered his voice.
  - Is it true that you refused a bribe from a betting house and arrested the attendant?
  - Yes.
  - Why the hell didn't you take the fucking bribe?
  - Because that would be against the <color=yellow>law</color>.
  - <color=yellow>Parovy</color> was having trouble controlling himself.
  - <color=purple>William</color>, is your salary good?
  - Ye...
  - No! It is not. The salary of all warriors sucks because we risked our damn lives
    and there's no money to pay for it.
  - The betting houses are our extra income and there's no reason to refuse the damn
    bribes. Nobody gains anything from it.
  - <color=yellow>Capta</color>...
  - Nobody!
  - "<color=yellow>Captain</color>! It is not our duty to legislate, we just follow
    the\u2026"
  - Silence! You've given me a huge amount of work these days, luckily I managed
    to negotiate with the betting houses, they'll ignore the shit you did as long
    as I release the guy you arrested and fire you.
  - <color=purple>William</color> wasn't going to beg for forgiveness, he just looked
    at him with contempt in his eyes, hoping that would upset <color=yellow>Captain
    Parovy</color>.
  - It may not seem like it, <color=purple>William</color>, but this is for your
    own good, otherwise the betting houses would hire an assassin to kill you.
