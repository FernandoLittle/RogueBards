  Dialogue:
  - Do you really think prayers work?
  - When I was young I didn't believe it. I thought that humans had invented a god
    who was a powerful human simply because we are sociable animals, our minds evolved
    precisely to have the ability to communicate with other humans.
  - "So it seemed obvious to me that <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> was a false god
    created by human imagination."
  - But one day I contracted the blue plague. What I hated most was not the disease
    but the treatment. The medications made my body boil and I had to keep taking
    them for months.
  - I wanted to give up several times, I thought dying from the plague would be much
    better, at least I would have a peaceful death. And even if I took all the meds
    I would only have a one in five chance of surviving.
  - "I was tired, ready to give up. And when I reached the deepest despair, I felt
    Shu\xE1 by my side, in that moment I felt that I was not alone, in that moment
    I knew that something greater was protecting and guiding me."
  - At that moment I knew that I would have the strength to defeat the blue plague.
  - "Why didn't <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> protect the four out of five people
    who underwent treatment and died?"
  - I don't know, and maybe he doesn't exist, maybe what I felt at that time was
    just an illusion.
  - But I guarantee you that if I hadn't believed him I would be dead by now.
  - Whether he exists or not, it was my belief in him that saved me not just from
    the plague, but from the despair and agony of facing death head-on, and for that
    I will always be grateful to him.
  - "Your story is beautiful <color=#FF0080>Kain</color>, if you are alive thanks
    to <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>, I also thank him."
  - The two prayed together in silence.
