  Dialogue:
  - The warm blood of that man made <color=purple>William</color> feel happy for
    the first time on that mission.
  - You are <color=red>smiling</color>.
  - <color=purple>William</color> was tired of pretending to be someone he wasn't.
  - Yes, I'm smiling, I killed a motherfucker who would kill you if it wasn't for
    me.
  - <color=#FF0080>Shu</color>'s path isn't about violence and revenge, it's about
    mercy and...
  - 'I''m tired of hearing speeches about love and kindness. This is a world of war
    and pain where the powerful rule and the weak obey.

    It makes me happy, you
    know why?'
  - Because I'm strong and I'm on the side that rules.
  - This talk of loving sinners and doing good is just a talk for the weak to feel
    better while obeying the strong.
  - I found the way to my happiness, I'm going to join the mercenaries of this damn
    war, make money and then... I don't know, I'm going to eat some whores in my
    personal harem.
  - (...)
  - Seasons came and went and <color=purple>William</color> finally found happiness,
    not in money, not in whores, but in the blood of his enemies, for in their death
    he felt alive and strong.
