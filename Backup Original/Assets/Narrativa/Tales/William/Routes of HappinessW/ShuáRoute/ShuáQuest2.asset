  Dialogue:
  - "Will <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> torture sinners?"
  - Torture is a very strong word, the scriptures of the monk <color=#FF0080>Harold</color>
    say that he will cleanse the souls of sinners with the greatest of pains.
  - "Is <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> kind for doing this?"
  - Yes.
  - "When I said that I wanted revenge, you condemned me and said that it would be
    a sin, but when <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> causes the greatest pain in humans,
    you say that this is a kind thing."
  - Imagine that you wake up one day and find that you accidentally killed a child
    while you were drunk.
  - Would you suffer?
  - Yes.
  - <color=black>This joke is funny, don't you think?</color>
  - Only a man with a corrupt soul does not suffer after sinning.
  - "When <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> purifies our souls after death, we repent
    of all our sins. The greatest pain that the scriptures mention is precisely the
    pain of repentance. This is not a punishment, but a necessary consequence of
    purification. "
  - "If <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> is so kind, why would he let us suffer if
    he could only give us pure happiness?"
  - Pain is important for us to become better people and to learn.
  - "<color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> could simply throw all souls into a lake of infinite
    pleasure, but what would that mean?"
  - "<color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> gave humans their greatest virtue, which is the
    ability to love. How could we love without understanding the meaning of pain
    and suffering?"
  - To love we need a world where suffering and happiness coexist so that our actions
    have some meaning.
  - Pain and suffering were about to arrive.
