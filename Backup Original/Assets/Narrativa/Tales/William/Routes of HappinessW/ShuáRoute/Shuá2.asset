  Dialogue:
  - May I join your prayer?
  - Good to see you <color=purple>William</color>, it will be a pleasure to pray
    with you.
  - What are you asking for?
  - I'm not asking in this prayer, I'm giving thanks.
  - We warriors don't have much to be thankful for these days. Everything is going
    wrong with us.
  - The life of all people is rich in misery. All humans feel hungry, get sick and
    die.
  - Exactly! Why would I thank you for this damn world?
  - Because even with all the misfortunes, we are alive in this brief moment that
    is tiny compared to the millions of years before our birth and the millions of
    years after our death.
  - Because we have water, we have food, we have health. All this will end and for
    that I thank him for this brief moment when I have everything I need.
  - Okay, you won, let's pray.
  - This time <color=#FF0080>Kain</color> began to pray aloud.
  - "<color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>, thank you, for in this world of suffering you
    have given us sources of happiness. Yesterday I was extremely happy with the
    one-third discount I received at the whorehouse, all my luck emanates from your
    will and for your will I am grateful."
  - <color=purple>William</color> was perplexed.
  - Are you thanking you for the discount you got at the whorehouse?
  - "It was a gift from <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>, shouldn't I thank him?"
  - "Of course not. You shouldn't be thankful for that because it wasn't a gift from
    Shu\xE1. All warriors receive discount at the whorehouse."
  - <color=#FF0080>Kain</color> was perplexed.
  - "Do all warriors receive a discount? Fuck <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>, <color=yellow>Lyoko</color>
    is the most amazing god of all."
  - Thank you, <color=yellow>Lyoko</color>!
