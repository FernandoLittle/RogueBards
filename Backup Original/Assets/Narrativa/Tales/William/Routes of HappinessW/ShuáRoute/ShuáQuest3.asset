  Dialogue:
  - "Is there a sin that <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> cannot forgive?"
  - "The only sinner that <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> does not forgive is the
    one in which the person does not repent."
  - "<color=purple>William</color> was sure <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> would
    forgive him, however monstrous his sin was."
  - He told the <color=#FF0080>monk</color> his biggest secret. His greatest cruelty.
    The rotten fruit of your selfishness.
  - The <color=#FF0080>monk</color> had already seen and heard terrible things, extremely
    cruel and repulsive sinners had already confessed to him.
  - But when he heard <color=purple>William</color>'s sins, he felt something he
    had never felt hearing a confession.
  - He felt pity.
  - I'm sorry, my lord. I'm sorry, <color=purple>William</color>.
  - "You must have suffered a lot, don't worry, <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> understands
    your suffering, he understands perfectly."
  - A war is not a place for forgiveness and mercy.
  - A war is a place for death and violence.
