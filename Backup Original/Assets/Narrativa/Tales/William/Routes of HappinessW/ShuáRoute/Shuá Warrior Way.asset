  - I do not believe that. Why would I follow a path of virtue? I know many good
    people who have tragic ends.
  - "Do you know why I follow <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>?"
  - "\u2026"
  - "I think <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>'s path is beautiful. I have a theory
    that people only do what is moral and virtuous because they see the beauty in
    it."
