  Dialogue:
  - Why are you attacking us motherfucker? We came from another country just to help
    the victims of war, asshole.
  - Don't pretend to be an idiot. The Mirians invaded our country, killed women and
    children, and you helped them.
  - "We were just following the <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> teachings. We were
    loving our enemies."
  - 'You can go to hell with the Mirians, you bastards. '
