  Dialogue:
  - "Tell me, <color=#FF0080>monk</color>. <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> is good?"
  - "Of course, my <color=purple>lord</color>. <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>'s love
    for humanity is infinite."
  - So why did he let my family be murdered?
  - I feel sorry for you, my <color=purple>lord</color>. I can't even imagine how
    much you suffered.
  - "<color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> did not protect your family because he is not
    omnipotent. His power depends on the love humans feel for one another. As long
    as people hate each other, murderers will destroy the lives of innocent families."
  - That's why I have to kill assassins. So that they stop hurting innocent people.
  - Therefore I must take revenge.
  - Revenge will not bring peace to your soul, my <color=purple>lord</color>.
  - What should I do then? I've lost everything I had, I've lost all my happiness,
    what's left for me but my revenge?
  - "<color=#FF0080>Kain</color> said that <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> brought
    peace and happiness to his heart."
  - <color=purple>William</color> wanted to be happy like him, but he blamed himself
    for having that desire. The warrior thought that he would only have the right
    to be happy after he fulfilled his duties.
  - Because he was stupid enough to believe that his sins could be atoned for that
    way.
  - Despite this, he wished with all his might that the Shuan <color=#FF0080>monk</color>
    would teach him to be happy.
  - You remind me of <color=#FF0080>Shu</color> in the parable of the lone warrior.
    In it, he loses all his colleagues in the war, he also loses all his hopes and
    dreams.
  - But in the midst of this war he meets a child who has seen his parents murdered
    in front of him.
  - He adopts that child and protects him. After that, his life has meaning and purpose
    again.
  - Do you understand the similarities of this parable and your story, my <color=purple>lord</color>?
  - Both <color=#FF0080>Shu</color> and I are warriors.
  - Not only that, you two lost everything. But when <color=#FF0080>Shu</color> found
    someone to protect, his life began to make sense again.
  - "Next season I will go on a mission together with other <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>
    followers into the <color=#yellow>Varsa War</color>. We will provide medical
    care and food for the victims of this war."
  - It's a dangerous zone there, so we need a strong man like you to defend us.
  - I have found my purpose in life by following the <color=#FF0080>Path of Shu</color>,
    if you want, I can help you follow that path.
  - "But you will need to abandon everything that goes against <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>'s
    will to come with us on this mission. This includes abandoning your plans for
    revenge and your work as a warrior. "
