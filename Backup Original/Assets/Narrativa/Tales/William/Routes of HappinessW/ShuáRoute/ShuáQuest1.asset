  Dialogue:
  - Where did that anger come from?
  - Was <color=purple>William</color> furious with those sinners?
  - No.
  - Even if those thugs were rapists and infanticides it didn't bother him because
    he was already used to living with that kind of scum when he worked as a warrior.
  - "<color=purple>William</color> was furious with the <color=#FF0080>monk</color>.
    That damned follower of <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> was tending the wounds
    of those bandits, listening to their sins and forgiving them."
  - The criminals' physical pain did not disappear when their wounds were treated,
    but their mental pain disappeared when they were forgiven by the <color=#FF0080>monk</color>.
  - That stupid monk thought the criminals were sorry, but <color=purple>William</color>
    knew they were just afraid of divine punishment.
  - '"I hope they get an infection and die."'
  - "\u201CThis motherfucking <color=#FF0080>monk</color> lied to me, I thought this
    mission would help the real victims of the war.\u201D"
  - '"I didn''t leave <color=yellow>Sarka</color> and come to a country at war wanting
    to help these damn criminals."'
  - "\u201CIf <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> forgives these thieves then I am an
    idiot, it is much better to be a criminal and live for yourself. I just need
    a <color=#FF0080>monk</color> to forgive me before I die.\u201D Pedir que o monge
    o perdoe. Questionar o monge"
