  Dialogue:
  - "I could kill you here, but that's not what <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> taught
    us. We came here to help all the victims and all the wounded that exist on both
    sides. Just leave us alone."
  - I don't like you, but I will reward your mercy by revealing information that
    could save you.
  - More soldiers are coming this way. You are strong, but you won't be able to defeat
    them all, I suggest you run away. We just want to kill the Mirians that are here.
  - "Run away, <color=purple>William</color>, you did a good job, <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>
    is happy to see your virtues."
  - I will stay here to defend the Mirians.
  - You've heard of the sins those bastards committed, why would you risk your life
    for them?
  - "The true mission of the <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color> followers is to lead
    sinners to the path of virtue. Those Mirians repented of their sins, I cannot
    allow them to die a brutal death."
  - There's no way you can calm the Varsians' wrath. If you stay here, you will die
    for nothing.
  - A monk is not afraid of death, our only fear is to deviate from the path of virtue.
  - Go away, my <color=purple>lord</color>.
  - Go away, <color=purple>William</color>, find your happiness as I found mine.
    Find Shuan love and spread it across this war world.
  - <color=purple>William</color> didn't look back as he fled, but he knew what had
    happened since it was so obvious.
  - "The Varsians brutally killed the Shuan <color=#FF0080>monk</color> because\u2026"
  - "This is not the world of <color=#FF0080>Shu\xE1</color>."
  - <color=black>This is my world. </color>
