  Dialogue:
  - Fuck where he was born, I've got better things to do than kick him out of the
    country.
  - You are unpatriotic.
  - Yes I am. Believe what you want, the door is there, buddy.
  - 'Just after <color=yellow>Otterg</color> opened the door, <color=purple>William</color>
    shouted:'
  - Hang on!
  - You lied to me, didn't you?
  - What? I didn't lie, I swear he's an illegal immigrant.
  - Not on that part. Your name is <color=yellow>Otterg Sasmark</color>, you clearly
    come from a Serician immigrant family, by the way, my grandfather also came from
    <color=yellow>Sericia</color>. In any case, it makes no sense for you to hate
    immigrants to the point of wanting to expel them if you are recently related
    to immigrants. Is there another reason behind your order, am I wrong?
  - "The real reason is\u2026 my wife cheated on me with that man."
  - Hm, so you're cuckold, it's a good reason and you had the guts to reveal it,
    which is admirable.
  - I'll help you then, adulterer has to fuck himself.
  - After the <color=yellow>cuckold</color>, left the room, <color=purple>William</color>
    let out a laugh that he struggled to hold back.
