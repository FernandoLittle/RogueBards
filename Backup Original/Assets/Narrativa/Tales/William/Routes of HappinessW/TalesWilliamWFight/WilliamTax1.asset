  Dialogue:
  - <color=purple>William</color> began to feel afraid, his job was simple, he just
    needed to arrest <color=green>Vlad Burarth</color>, a bourgeois guilty of tax
    evasion.
  - 'That bourgeois was weak, offered no resistance to arrest, and followed <color=purple>William</color>''s
    orders without hesitation. He disobeyed only one order:'
  - Say something.
  - Silence.
  - That silence was terrifying.
  - Why are you smiling? Answer me!
  - Silence.
  - <color=purple>William</color> tried to ignore it, but it was difficult, he had
    never met someone so calm and with such an air of superiority.
  - His smile of pure satisfaction was frightening.
  - I know why you're smiling, you're going to hire an assassin to kill me, be silent
    if my hypothesis is correct.
  - 'This time he managed to wrest an answer from the <color=green>bourgeois</color>:'
  - I would never do that.
  - Five days later an assassin was in front of him.
