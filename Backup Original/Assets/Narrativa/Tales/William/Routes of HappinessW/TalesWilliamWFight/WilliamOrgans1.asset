  Dialogue:
  - <color=purple>William</color>, you really want to go on this mission, you're
    going to put doctors in prison, that's dangerous.
  - More dangerous than our daily work?
  - Yes. Doctors are rich and the sale of organs is a crime protected by the assassins'
    guild. That means the assassins will come to you.
  - These doctors are enriching themselves with our colleagues' organs, you saw what
    <color=#FF0080>Kain</color> said about the investigations, <color=yellow>Marlov</color>
    was held captive for months only to be quartered and had his organs implanted
    into corrupt aristocrats.
  - "<color=yellow>Marlov</color> was a friend of mine for years, every month we
    had dinner together. I thank you for avenging him, <color=purple>William</color>.
    But take care, every good warrior ends up getting a bounty on his head. A big
    bounty means assassins chasing you and\u2026"
  - And what?
  - And you are a very good warrior, be careful.
  - <color=purple>William</color>'s mission was very successful and three surgeons
    linked to organ trafficking were arrested. But <color=yellow>Parovy</color>'s
    prediction was correct, an assassin came to cut off <color=purple>William</color>'s
    head.
