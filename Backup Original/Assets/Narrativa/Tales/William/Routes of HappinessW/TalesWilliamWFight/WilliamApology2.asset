  Dialogue:
  - "The third pillar\u2026"
  - <color=purple>William</color> already imagined that that bard would argue against
    the arrest and say something about freedom of speech.
  - Be quiet, nothing you say can prevent you from being arrested.
  - "<color=red>Kuvira</color>'s third pillar\u2026 freedom of speech."
  - <color=purple>William</color> thought how predictable that bard was, he didn't
    even understand that he was being arrested for raising his daggers against a
    warrior and not for the music he played.
  - You bards are too cowardly to commit crimes into your own hands, but your music
    constantly encourages people to break the law. <color=red>Kuvira</color> always
    made it very clear that apology for crime would never be allowed.
  - We are free only to agree with the <color=yellow>law</color>.
  - That bard began to laugh.
  - Why are you laughing? You lost.
  - I lost a fight, but I won where it matters. I won in being happier, because while
    you decided to be a slave to the <color=yellow>law</color>, I decided to be a
    slave to my passions. Even if I die now, I will be satisfied that I lived my
    life to the fullest.
  - Are you happier than me?
  - <color=purple>William</color> reduced that bard's happiness.
  - And now?
  - I'm sorry.
  - <color=purple>William</color> reduced that bard's happiness.
  - Please! Stop... please.
  - Are you even happier than I am?
  - Please! Stop... please.
  - No... No!
  - That bard started having trouble breathing.
  - "You're more\u2026happy\u2026than I am."
  - <color=purple>William</color>'s <color=red>happiness</color> increased.
