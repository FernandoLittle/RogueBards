  Dialogue:
  - '<color=purple>William</color> liked the nights just as he liked the solitude.
    He was resting sitting on a bench in a silent square, until his moment of peace
    was destroyed by a <color=yellow>drug dealer</color> who asked:'
  - Do you want opium?
  - Do you have shit in your head or what? Can't you recognize a warrior when you
    see one?
  - The <color=yellow>dealer</color> never felt so stupid and never got so scared,
    he apologized and tried to run, but <color=purple>William</color> grabbed his
    arm.
  - Don't worry, I won't arrest you or hurt you, but you have to tell me where the
    guy who hired you is.
  - The <color=yellow>drug dealer</color> felt stupid once again, he had no reason
    to be afraid, that <color=purple>warrior</color> would never hurt him.
  - The guy who hired me? He's fucking your mother, that bitch.
  - '<color=purple>William</color> took a deep breath:'
  - I'll ask again, please answer me, who hired you?
  - It is not obvious? Your father hired me, but you mustn't know him, he's a bard
    with a half-meter dick.
  - <color=purple>William</color> was silent, looking at the <color=yellow>dealer</color>
    for a long, unpleasant time.
  - I don't usually lie, so heed my warning, it's in your best interest to answer
    this question, who hired you and where is he?
  - Fuck you.
  - The <color=yellow>drug dealer</color> felt like an idiot once again, that <color=purple>warrior</color>
    was indeed capable of hurting him. The punch was so strong that he lost a tooth.
    Fortunately, this was not a very serious problem, as a new tooth was already
    growing to replace the old one.
  - 'After holding the drug dealer by the mouth, <color=purple>William</color> said:'
  - Is it in your best interest to stop crying and answer me, who hired you and where
    is he?
  - The <color=yellow>drug dealer</color> lied, giving the name and address of a
    assassin he knew. <color=purple>William</color> naively believed and, the next
    day, he was faced with an opponent much stronger than he imagined.
