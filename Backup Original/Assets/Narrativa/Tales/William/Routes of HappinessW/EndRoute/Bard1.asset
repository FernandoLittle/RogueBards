  Dialogue:
  - No matter how many times <color=purple>William</color> cleaned his house, it
    still smelled like blood.
  - <color=purple>William</color>'s sword had that same smell.
  - That smell aroused disgust in him.
  - It aroused regret.
  - It aroused hatred.
  - It was that scent that guided him on his quest for revenge.
  - No one but him could smell that scent, but he knew it was something real. It
    was impossible that such a strong smell was merely an illusion.
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> sharpened his sword.
  - '"<color=#FF0080>Maduin</color> is an idiot."'
  - '"To have pity on criminals is foolish."'
  - '"All they deserve is suffering."'
  - '"Yes".'
  - <color=purple>William</color> gave a big smile.
  - "\"Suffering\u2026 I want to see that motherfucking bard scream in pain.\""
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> sharpened his sword.
  - '"That damn bard. He drank with me, he laughed with me, he sang with me."'
  - '"He made me sin against my father."'
  - '"Is there a greater sin than being a friend to your own father''s murderer?"'
  - '"<color=red>Exists</color>."'
  - '"He will suffer."'
  - <color=purple>William</color> didn't think about what his life would be like
    after that day. He didn't think about his friends, about his dreams, about his
    values.
  - He didn't think because he didn't have any of that.
  - The only thing he had was his revenge plan.
  - From the moment he left his house to the moment he arrived at the bard's house,
    the <color=purple>warrior</color> took several steps.
  - He didn't look at the landscape, he didn't look at the people, he didn't look
    at the sky, he didn't look at the path.
  - The only thing he could see as he walked that path was his desire for revenge.
  - <color=purple>William</color> stopped in front of the bard's house door.
  - '"It''s now, the moment I''ve always waited for has arrived."'
  - 'But the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> wasn''t home, he was behind <color=purple>William</color>,
    hiding in the shadows. Recognizing the beautiful necklace the <color=purple>warrior</color>
    was wearing, he said:'
  - I was waiting for you, son of <color=blue>Roy</color>.
