  Dialogue:
  - No matter how many times <color=purple>William</color> cleaned his house, it
    still smelled like blood.
  - <color=purple>William</color>'s sword had that same smell.
  - That smell aroused disgust in him.
  - It aroused regret.
  - It aroused hatred.
  - It was that scent that guided him on his quest for revenge.
  - No one but him could smell that scent, but he knew it was something real. It
    was impossible that such a strong smell was merely an illusion.
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> sharpened his sword.
  - '"<color=#FF0080>Maduin</color> is an idiot."'
  - '"To have pity on criminals is foolish."'
  - '"All they deserve is suffering."'
  - '"Yes".'
  - <color=purple>William</color> gave a big smile.
  - "\"Suffering\u2026 I want to see that motherfucking bard scream in pain.\""
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> sharpened his sword.
  - '"That damn bard. He drank with me, he laughed with me, he sang with me."'
  - '"He made me sin against my father."'
  - '"Is there a greater sin than being a friend to your own father''s murderer?"'
  - '"<color=red>Exists</color>."'
  - '"He will suffer."'
  - <color=purple>William</color> didn't think about what his life would be like
    after that day. He didn't think about his friends, about his dreams, about his
    values.
  - He didn't think because he didn't have any of that.
  - The only thing he had was his revenge plan.
  - From the moment he left his house to the moment he arrived at the bard's house,
    the <color=purple>warrior</color> took several steps.
  - He didn't look at the landscape, he didn't look at the people, he didn't look
    at the sky, he didn't look at the path.
  - The only thing he could see as he walked that path was his desire for revenge.
  - <color=purple>William</color> stopped in front of the bard's house door.
  - '"It''s now, the moment I''ve always waited for has arrived."'
  - 'But the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> wasn''t home, he was behind <color=purple>William</color>
    hiding in the shadows. Recognizing the beautiful necklace the <color=purple>warrior</color>
    was wearing, he said:'
  - I was waiting for you, son of <color=blue>Roy</color>.
  DialogueBR:
  - "N\xE3o importa quantas vezes <color=purple>William</color> limpasse sua casa,
    ela ainda cheirava a sangue."
  - A espada de <color=purple>William</color> tinha o mesmo cheiro.
  - Aquele cheiro despertava nojo nele.
  - Despertaca arrependimento.
  - "Despertava \xF3dio."
  - "Foi esse cheiro que o guiou em sua busca por vingan\xE7a."
  - "Ningu\xE9m al\xE9m dele podia sentir aquele cheiro, mas ele sabia que era algo
    real. Era imposs\xEDvel que um cheiro t\xE3o forte fosse apenas uma ilus\xE3o."
  - O <color=purple>guerreiro</color> afiou sua espada.
  - "\"<color=#FF0080>Maduin</color> \xE9 um idiota.\""
  - "\"Ter pena de criminosos \xE9 idiotice.\""
  - "\"Tudo o que eles merecem \xE9 sofrimento.\""
  - '"Sim".'
  - <color=purple>William</color> deu um grande sorriso.
  - '"Sofrimento... eu quero ver aquele bardo filho da puta gritar de dor."'
  - O <color=purple>guerreiro</color> afiou sua espada.
  - '"Maldito bardo. Ele bebeu comigo, riu comigo, cantou comigo."'
  - '"Ele me fez pecar contra meu pai."'
  - "\"Existe pecado maior do que se tornar amigo do assassino de seu pr\xF3prio
    pai?\""
  - '"<color=red>Existe</color>."'
  - '"Ele vai sofrer."'
  - "<color=purple>William</color> n\xE3o pensou em como seria sua vida depois daquele
    dia. Ele n\xE3o pensou nos seus amigos, nos sonhos ou nos seus valores."
  - "Ele n\xE3o pensou porque ele n\xE3o tinha nada disso."
  - "A \xFAnica coisa que ele tinha era seu plano de vingan\xE7a."
  - "Desde o momento em que saiu de sua casa at\xE9 o momento em que chegou \xE0
    casa do bardo, o <color=purple>guerreiro</color> deu v\xE1rios passos."
  - "Ele n\xE3o olhou para a paisagem, n\xE3o olhou para as pessoas, n\xE3o olhou
    para o c\xE9u, n\xE3o olhou para o caminho."
  - "A \xFAnica coisa que ele podia ver enquanto percorria aquele caminho era seu
    desejo de vingan\xE7a."
  - <color=purple>William</color> parou na frente da porta da casa do bardo.
  - "\"\xC9 agora, o momento que eu sempre esperei chegou.\""
  - "Mas o <color=#00FFBF>bardo</color> n\xE3o estava em casa, ele estava atr\xE1s
    de <color=purple>William</color>, escondido nas sombras. Reconhecendo o lindo
    colar que o <color=purple>guerreiro</color> estava usando, ele disse:"
  - "Eu estava esperando por voc\xEA, filho de <color=blue>Roy</color>."
