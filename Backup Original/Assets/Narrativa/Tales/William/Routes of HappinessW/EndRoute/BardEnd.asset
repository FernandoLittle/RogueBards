  Dialogue:
  - Go to Ebu's house, sleep with her, I'll pick you up tomorrow.
  - Why can't I stay here, father?
  - Because I have an important job, you'll get in my way if you stick around.
  - "<color=#FF0080>L\xE1zaro</color> knew what his father's old job was, so he hid
    near his house instead of taking shelter in Ebu's house."
  - Because he was too brave to run away while his father was in danger.
  - <color=green>Akasha</color> reserved a special gift for the brave.
  - "Seeing <color=purple>William</color> having fun breaking the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>'s
    arms and legs, <color=#FF0080>L\xE1zaro</color> ran to help his father."
  - Stop! Please don't kill my father!
  - People fear death a lot, it's strange because only the living are capable of
    suffering.
  - Don't worry about him, young man, for I won't kill him. And don't worry about
    yourself, you won't suffer anymore.
  - 'As <color=red>William</color> took his sword, the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>
    gathered all his strength to overcome the pain of his broken limbs and say:'
  - You will kill...
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> screamed, his physical pain unbearable.
  - "You're going to kill a\u2026an innocent person."
  - In exchange for nothing.
  - He's not my son...
  - "I do not love him\u2026"
  - Killing him won't bother me one bit.
  - "He's just a child\u2026 wretched\u2026 that I picked up on the street\u2026"
  - "Those were the last words <color=#FF0080>L\xE1zaro</color> heard."
