  Dialogue:
  - This story is going to be quite long. Where do I start... <color=purple>William</color>
    woke up strapped to a chair in front of some linibs.
  - '"This is a dream?"'
  - "\u201CThis is my favorite food, but nobody knows about it. It would be too much
    of a coincidence for someone to put linibs here for no reason.\u201D"
  - "\u201CFurthermore, linibs are pancakes from Serician cuisine. Nobody eats that
    in Sarka.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYes, this is a dream.\u201D"
  - '"But the smell feels so real."'
  - '"Whatever, I have olfactory hallucinations all the time."'
  - "\u2026"
  - '"Linibs are said to accompany people from birth to death. Does that mean I''m
    going to die?"'
  - '"They are also used to celebrate the end of winter. Should be it. Winter is
    ending."'
  - '"Memories of the last fight came to him."'
  - "\"That woman defeated me with a single blow. She grabbed my neck with her legs\u2026
    it was really weird.\""
  - '"Damn it! I must be dead. Is life after death like this?"'
  - '"Did I get what I liked most after I died? "'
  - '"A linib? I don''t want a fucking linib, I want my family. Where are they?"'
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> who defeated him entered the room.
  - You're finally awake.
  - The image of that woman made <color=purple>William</color> realize that he was
    neither dead nor dreaming.
  - You want to talk?
  - I want to kill you.
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> sat opposite the <color=purple>warrior</color>,
    among them were the linibs.
  - You want to talk?
  - "\u2026"
  - Why did you prepare linibs?
  - I'm not a good cook. Linib is one of the only foods I know how to prepare. Also,
    the ingredients are cheap.
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> ate some.
  - Do you want?
  - "\u2026"
  - The woman took a piece from the part where she had bitten off and put it in <color=purple>William</color>'s
    mouth.
  - Did you like it?
  - She was trying to make a seductive voice as she spoke.
  - They say that eating something that someone else has bitten is like an indirect
    kiss.
  - The man kicked her and then kicked the linibs to the ground.
  - Why did you do that?
  - Because you're a <color=purple>assassin</color>, because you're a whore, and
    because you're kidding me with this kissing thing.
  - "I wasn't kidding. Sharing saliva is unhygienic, so we only do it with our sex
    partners, if you eat something someone else has bi\u2026"
  - Do you like saliva? So take it.
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> managed to land a spit on the <color=purple>assassin</color>'s
    face.
  - In response she wiped the spit with her fingers and then licked those same fingers.
  - Spit again.
  - Go fuck yourself, bitch.
  - Yea! Insult me more!
  - She started to make a higher pitched voice, as if she was feeling a lot of pleasure.
  - <color=purple>William</color> began to struggle trying to untie himself from
    the chair, but the only thing he managed to do was fall pathetically.
  - I'm just kidding you, silly. You don't have to be so angry.
  - Memories of the past flashed through William's mind, something in that room was
    familiar to him. Maybe it was that food, the <color=purple>warrior</color> loved
    to eat linibs with his family during childhood.
  - "\u201CWhy am I thinking about this now?\u201D"
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> lifted him.
  - I see you don't like my company anymore. This is very sad.
  - If you fall again, you won't be able to get up on your own, so behave yourself.
  - The woman left leaving the man alone in that lonely room.
  - Linibs weren't particularly tasty, but <color=purple>William</color> had fond
    memories of a time when he ate them.
  - A time when his father and sisters were alive. They had good times together.
  - '"Those moments will never come back, even if I take revenge."'
  - <color=purple>William</color> looked at the Linibs on the floor, but he couldn't
    remember the good times he'd had with his family.
  - The only thing he could think about was his failures.
  - A linib bitten on the floor was like his life.
  - "\u201CI had a completely miserable life.\""
  - '"I wasted her letting hate consume my soul."'
  - '"The good times in my life will never come back."'
  - '"At least that <color=purple>assassin</color> will end all my misery."'
  - 'I''m not even halfway through the story yet. Please don''t lose to her again.
    I don''t want to have to tell this story again. It''s easy to defeat her, you
    just need to beat the first skill, I think

    One centiday has passed.'
  - One deciday has passed.
  - One day has passed.
  - But the hunger did not go away.
  - But the thirst did not go away.
  - I went back!
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> carried several grapes with her.
  - Sweet grapes that could quench <color=purple>William</color>'s thirst and hunger
    at once.
  - "\u201CDamn bitch. She brought this to torture me. An <color=purple>assassin</color>
    would never feed a captive such expensive food.\u201D"
  - They're delicious, want some?
  - Is this really happening? Will she give me those grapes?
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> chewed a grape and then spat it out.
  - Open your mouth.
  - <color=purple>William</color> ate that grape. Despite being chewed, it was still
    delicious.
  - His thirst and hunger weren't over yet.
  - You want more?
  - "\u2026"
  - Yes.
  - Beg.
  - I beg you, please, I need more.
  - The <color=purple>assassin</color> chewed on another grape and struggled to add
    a lot of saliva as she spit it out.
  - Normally the man would find this absolutely disgusting, but his thirst made him
    crave that woman's saliva.
  - 'After several grapes his hunger and thirst were quenched and he asked:'
  - You knew I planned to avenge my father. Who are you?
  - This revenge thing is pretty boring. You sound like an assassin talking like
    that.
  - My father was murdered, obviously I need to avenge him.
  - People only care about their families because of natural selection.
  - The trait of caring for family members makes individuals more likely to propagate
    their traits, this made brotherly love spread like a plague.
  - Proof of this is that several animals show this love. This is something completely
    animalistic and irrational.
  - Fuck brothers, parents and children. None of this has any value, these things
    are chains that natural selection has forged to enslave us.
  - And a slave who loves his chains is completely worthless.
  - You dont answer my question.
  - Who are you?
  - The woman gave a gentle smile.
  - I am the <color=purple>Lady of Death</color>.
  - Ebu was known as the greatest assassin in <color=yellow>Sarka</color>'s history,
    but few were afraid of her.
  - People feared another woman.
  - A woman who never killed a single person.
  - The <color=purple>Lady of Death</color>.
  - The people Ebu killed became statistics.
  - But the <color=purple>Lady of Death</color> was different. She tortured and disfigured
    her victims. <color=purple>William</color> remembered all the warriors who had
    been tortured by her. He also remembered all the pity he felt for them.
  - The moment the <color=purple>Lady of Death</color> revealed her identity, <color=purple>William</color>
    understood the true meaning of fear.
  - The woman began to heat her blade in the fireplace.
  - "Please kill me, I'll do what you want. I cater to your fetishes, I\u2026 I give
    you information, please, I'm not asking too much."
  - Relax, I'll take it easy on you.
  - I'm not going to disfigure your face because I think it's very cute.
  - I'm just going to amputate your legs so you have to crawl across the floor when
    you move.
  - You will get used to it.
  - Also, I'll write the Assassin's Guild motto on your forehead with this knife.
  - '"Don''t hurt the peaceful." That''s a very nice motto, don''t you think?'
  - She took the blade from the fireplace and smiled again.
  - Please kill me.
  - That's all I'm asking for.
  - I am not a butcher. I am an <color=red>artist</color>. What's the point of killing
    you? How would things get better with your death?
  - My plan is a lot more fun than yours.
  - If you become my work of art, people will see you.
  - Your scars will make people afraid of the Guild and when all people are afraid
    of the Guild, <color=yellow>Sarka</color> will be a peaceful country.
  - Peaceful country? What a joke.
  - You can continue with your plan.
  - But first you'll have to look me in the eye and tell me you're doing this for
    peace and not because you enjoy torturing others.
  - If you don't, you'll have to kill me.
  - The <color=purple>Lady of Death</color> approached, looked <color=purple>William</color>
    in the eye, tried to hold back a laugh and failed.
  - 'After laughing, she said:'
  - Damn it! I can't lie without laughing.
  - You're right, I have a lot of fun torturing others. Although I'll be a little
    upset about hurting you.
  - I really like you.
  - Besides, it would be an unforgiven sin to kill you.
  - <color=purple>William</color> knew well about unforgivable sins and yet he didn't
    understand what this woman was saying
  - I have an idea! You will receive some of my mercy.
  - I'll knock you unconscious while I do my job.
  - Sleep well, <color=purple>Will</color>.
