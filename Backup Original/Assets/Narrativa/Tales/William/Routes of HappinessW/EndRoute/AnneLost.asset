  Dialogue:
  - Why are you attacking me, <color=purple>Will</color>? It's me, <color=purple>Anne</color>,
    your sister.
  - My sisters are dead.
  - "No, <color=purple>Will</color>, I disappeared the day our father died because
    the \rassassin kidnapped me."
  - I managed to escape recently and soon started looking for you, I was so happy
    to see that you had followed our father's path and become a warrior.
  - I do not believe you. Why would it take you so long to escape? Why were you armed?
    Why would you invite me to this hill?
  - Why do you think I called you to this place?
  - Because you were going to ambush and kill me.
  - Of course not, silly! This is where Dad took us to see the stars, we promised
    we'd get married when we were adults on a full moon like this.
  - <color=purple>William</color> hugged his sister and began to cry like a child.
  - <color=purple>Anne</color>, you're alive! I can't believe it, this is too good
    to be true.
  - "I\u2026 I almost killed you\u2026 I'm sorry. I couldn't recognize you, you've
    changed a lot. I'm a <color=black>monster</color>, I almost..."
  - I almost committed that sin again.
  - It's my fault <color=purple>Will</color>, I wanted to surprise you.
  - I should have met you as a normal person, but I forgot that you were always afraid
    of the dark.
  - This here is a gift for you, this is my lucky necklace, I hope you like it.
  - The two watched the stars as they talked about everything they had been through
    in the years they were apart.
  - <color=purple>William</color> understood that moment as much as he understood
    the size of the stars.
  - About what we agreed to marry, it won't happen, I'm gay.
  - And incest is wrong.
  - <color=purple>Anne</color> laughed.
  - Stop being silly, we were kids. Even though you look really nice. I bet you're
    stealing men's hearts.
  - I wish. There's a friend I like at work, <color=#FF0080>Maduin</color>, but I
    don't have the courage to confess this to him.
  - He is handsome?
  - Yes, quite, the most beautiful I've ever seen. He's also kind, affectionate,
    doesn't even look like a warrior.
  - Tell me more! When did you fall in love?
  - "When I fell in love\u2026 I think it was when I saw that he always brought meals
    that he prepared for the prisoners. The warriors were furious and he lost several
    friends there, but even so he continued to prepare the bandits' favorite foods."
  - How can he be so nice, even to criminals?
  - <color=purple>Anne</color> laughed because she knew the answer. Soon she started
    humming.
  - <color=purple>William</color> is in love, <color=purple>William</color> is in
    love, <color=purple>William</color> is in love.
  - I'm not, I have no right to fall in love and be happy until I fulfill my mission.
  - I have to kill our father's assassin.
  - <color=purple>William</color>, our father's killer is the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>.
  - What bard?
  - The <color=#00FFBF>Bard of Bards</color>.
