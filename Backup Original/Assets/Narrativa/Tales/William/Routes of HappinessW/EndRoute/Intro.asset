  Dialogue:
  - Day after day <color=purple>William</color> investigated to try to find out who
    was his father's killer.
  - The one responsible for killing the soldiers who fought in <color=purple>Denai</color>
    was the former leader of the Assassin's Guild, but after retiring he left few
    clues to his existence.
  - The most obvious plan would be to capture the current Guild leader Ebu Setamo
    Liada and extract information from her using torture. But <color=purple>William</color>
    didn't have the courage to face an enemy who possessed angelic weapons.
  - Fortunately, a letter arrived to solve all his problems.
  - '"I know who your father''s killer is, meet me at the top of Peace Hill at midnight
    on the 105th of winter."'
  - This is a stupidly obvious trap, clearly an assassin is going to ambush me taking
    advantage of the darkness and vegetation on the hill.
  - But <color=purple>William</color> was not a coward, instead of ignoring the letter,
    he decided to turn the tables and ambush the assassin.
  - He arrived at the top of the hill on the morning of the day 103 and camped for
    two days hiding among the trees and waiting for an assassin to arrive.
  - The darkness of day 104 was terrifying, knowing that an assassin would come to
    him in the midst of the darkness brought immense agony to his soul.
  - He soon regretted his decisions, but it was too late to go back, the only thing
    he could do was stay silent and wait.
  - Every noise made her heart race, a noise could be a wind, an animal or a damn
    killer wanting to cut her throat.
  - Ironically, calm ran through her body just as the <color=purple>assassin</color>
    appeared, her silhouette visible in the moonlight and strangely she didn't hide.
  - <color=purple>William</color> attacked with all his fury, but the assassin managed
    to defend herself.
