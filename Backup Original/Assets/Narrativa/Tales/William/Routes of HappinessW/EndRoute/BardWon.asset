  Dialogue:
  - I have two questions for you.
  - First question, how many children did <color=blue>Roy</color> have?
  - <color=purple>William</color> loved talking to his victims after they were defeated.
    Seeing the <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> do the same to him was absolutely unbearable.
  - Three.
  - He had three children. One became a <color=purple>warrior</color>, another became
    a <color=purple>demon</color>, another died in agony.
  - Second question, how many people died in <color=purple>Denai</color>?
  - <color=purple>William</color> was losing more blood by the moment, he wanted
    to lose consciousness and bleed to death soon for this humiliating scene to end.
  - Three hundred and one.
  - Three hundred and one people died in <color=purple>Denai</color>.<color=blue>Roy</color>
    participated in this massacre to save you and your sisters.
  - Because at that time the military were the only ones who could provide food security
    for their children.
  - I understand your father, as I understand you. But like <color=blue>Roy</color>,
    I'm just doing my job.
  - <color=purple>William</color>'s last wish came true, his conscience blanked before
    he finished listening to that pathetic speech.
