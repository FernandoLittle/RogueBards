  Dialogue:
  - As he was leaving the cemetery, <color=purple>William</color> heard a young man
    talking to himself. Two words caught the warrior's attention, "father" and "sorry."
  - May I sit here?
  - Feel free.
  - I also came here to apologize to my father.
  - Who knew that a young bard and a warrior would have something in common.
  - Are you a bard? Doesn't that missing finger get in the way of playing?
  - You are quite sociable for a warrior. Making conversation in a cemetery, shamelessly
    talking about someone's disability. Did you know that there is a saying among
    bards that is "if you don't want to be arrested, never talk to a warrior"?
  - I'm sorry.
  - Regretful, <color=purple>William</color> got up to leave.
  - I'm joking with you. In this cemetery there are no bards and warriors, here there
    are only the living and the dead.
  - Sit down and I'll tell you the story of how I lost my finger.
  - The <color=purple>warrior</color> obeyed the <color=#FF0080>young bard</color>.
  - I worked in a factory, before the government banned child labor.
  - I lost my finger in an accident.
  - ...
  - Yes, I know it's not an interesting story.
  - I'm sorry, it's a shame kids had to work back then.
  - I still had to work even after child labor was abolished. Otherwise I would starve.
  - At least I got a new job afterwards. But I would be glad to lose a hand instead
    of a finger if I could keep working in that factory.
  - What job did you get after?
  - The <color=#FF0080>young bard</color> was silent until <color=purple>William</color>
    felt uncomfortable and left.
