  Dialogue:
  - <color=yellow>Cold Mello</color> is dead.
  - No warrior in that room knew how to react to this news.
  - He was carrying out an operation to arrest a bandit who was enticing minors to
    traffic drugs.
  - During the operation, the assassins ambushed him and cut off his head. His head
    was exposed in a public square and shocked all the residents.
  - The criminals' objective is clear, they want to intimidate us, they want to overcome
    us by fear, they want to create chaos.
  - <color=yellow>Mello</color>'s head could be mine, it could be yours, it could
    be any warrior's. We can retreat now, or we can advance. We can enforce the law
    or we can let crime proliferate. Our determination will decide whether this land
    belongs to crime or belongs to Sarka.
  - I will not force any of you to fight, but if you want to honor Mello's legacy,
    I will be by your side fighting on the front lines.
  - Will you fight?
  - One by one the warriors rose and raised their swords and shouted let's go. <color=purple>William</color>
    did the same.
  - He felt like he had no choice, for some reason he would rather risk his life
    fighting the assassins than be the only coward in the room who didn't raise his
    sword.
