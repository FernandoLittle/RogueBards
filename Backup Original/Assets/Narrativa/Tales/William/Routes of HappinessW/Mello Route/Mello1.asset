  Dialogue:
  - Everyone in <color=yellow>Sarka</color> wants to be a vagabond's bitch.
  - Speak down, <color=yellow>Mello</color>.
  - <color=purple>William</color> looked around, hoping no one in that bar was paying
    attention to them.
  - Hey, I think you've had enough to drink.
  - Who cares? Who cares if I die now? Nobody.
  - What do you mean? I care, man. What happened? You are not like that.
  - "Every day we warriors risk our lives for\u2026 for\u2026 for what?"
  - <color=yellow>Mello</color> sobbed.
  - To protect people, I think. And we're treated like villains in this shit country.
  - "Speak down, <color=yellow>Mello</color>! To say that this country is a shi\u2026
    to offend the homeland is a crime."
  - I shit, nobody cares. Bards say worse things all the time. Just yesterday there
    was a damn bard singing a song glorifying a drug dealer who fucked a warrior's
    wife.
  - "I bet it was a true story, this\u2026 this world is rotten."
  - <color=yellow>Mello</color>, I know how you feel. Every warrior feels it, we
    risk our lives for the people and we are treated like villains in songs, even
    in the newspaper at times. But on the bright side, parliament has passed a law
    banning newspapers from publishing unpatriotic news.
  - That doesn't solve anything, we're dying for shitty people who hate us.
  - <color=purple>William</color> gave his friend a hug.
  - You're a good person man, I know your heart, don't let the heartache consume
    you.
  - "My mom\u2026 My mother is sick, she needs me for everything, there is no one
    but me who can take care of her."
  - <color=yellow>Mello</color> started to cry.
  - "If I die, she will be alone\u2026 Why am I risking my life?"
  - Why, <color=purple>William</color>? Answer me.
  - This story reminded <color=purple>William</color> of the worst day of his life.
  - I think I know why people sympathize with bandits more than warriors. We risk
    our lives for something greater and few can understand it.
  - Most people are selfish and therefore identify with criminals much more than
    with us.
  - You are a strong man, <color=yellow>Mello</color>.
  - You are a warrior.
  - Do not give up on the path of justice.
  - <color=purple>William</color> felt very proud to have given this great <color=red>advice</color>.
