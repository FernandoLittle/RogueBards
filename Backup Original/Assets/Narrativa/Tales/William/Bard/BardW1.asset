  Dialogue:
  - William shed a tear, not of sadness, not of regret, but of gratitude to hear
    such beautiful music while drinking a beer.
  - Hey bard, come here, your drink is on me tonight.
  - Thank you very much, young man. It's the first time a warrior has offered me
    a drink.
  - I have no prejudice against you.
  - Yet.
  - Yes, yet.
  - The bard had a good laugh.
  - Perhaps you should, young man. A good bard is a friend to dealers and loan sharks.
  - Aren't you afraid to confess it in front of a warrior?
  - The bard smiled kindly.
  - No.
  - That's why I don't have prejudices, no one would imagine that there were brave
    bards.
  - The bard laughed.
  - "A free drink and a compliment like that, warriors are kind these days. I need
    to reward you somehow\u2026 do you want me to teach you how to play some music?"
  - It's fine by me, I'm off today.
  - Perfect! I'll teach you how to play that song.
