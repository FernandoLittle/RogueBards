  Dialogue:
  - <color=purple>William</color> was thinking about death, normally he felt angry
    at the thought of it, but at that moment he felt gratitude.
  - He was grateful thanks to the bard who played beautiful music, death would one
    day come and he would have wasted most of his life thinking about a future that
    would never come.
  - In that brief moment he appreciated the present
  - That song reminded him that he could breathe and that no matter how ephemeral
    his life was, at least in an instant he was happy, because in that instant he
    noticed everything he had.
  - Hey <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>, thanks for the song, let me buy you a drink.
  - The pleasure of playing is mine.
  - The pleasure of drinking too.
  - The <color=00FFBF>bard</color> have a small laugh.
  - What's your name, <color=purple>young man</color>?
  - <color=purple>Willian Ulbricht</color>.
  - "Ulbricht? I remember someone with that name\u2026 who was it? Old age is melting
    my memory. Whatever, it shouldn't be someone important."
  - And your name, do you remember?
  - My name is a secret, but you can call me <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>.
  - Why don't you tell me?
  - I'm not going to tell my name to a warrior, imagine if you guys find out I work
    with drug dealers and assassins? I have to stay discreet.
  - Very funny. Aren't you afraid to say that to a warrior?
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> smiled kindly.
  - No.
  - Whatever, your music put me in a good mood. If you teach me how to play it, I'll
    pretend I didn't hear that.
  - It will be my pleasure to teach you, <color=purple>young man</color>.
