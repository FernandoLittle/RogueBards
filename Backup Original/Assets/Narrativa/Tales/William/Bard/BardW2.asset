  Dialogue:
  - What existed in Bel Mont? The bard asked this question several times in his song,
    but never answered it. This made William curious.
  - '"Hey bard, I''ll buy you a drink if you answer a question."'
  - I will be happy to answer you, young man.
  - What was in Bel Mont?
  - The bard laughed.
  - This is a very difficult question, my friend. What would motivate a man to fight
    an invincible enemy?
  - There are no invincible enemies.
  - You're absolutely right, there's a legendary battle where peasants defeated an
    entire army, even though they were incredibly outnumbered. The only strength
    they had was a deep desire to protect their families and their land.
  - You bards exaggerate everything, that's impossible.
  - The bard smiled.
  - You're absolutely right,
  - But I liked this song, I'll learn to play it.
  - The bard laughed.
  - A warrior learning to play a song where the national army is the villain, this
    is the first time I've seen it.
  - The army is the villain? I didn't even notice..
  - Great! We bards write our songs subtly so the warriors don't realize we're doing
    propaganda against them.
  - Aren't you afraid to say that in front of a warrior?
  - The bard smiled kindly.
  - No.
