  Dialogue:
  - What existed in <color=cyan>Bel Mont</color>? The <color=00FFBF>bard</color>
    asked this question several times in his song, but never answered it. This made
    <color=purple>William</color> curious.
  - Hey <color=#00FFBF>bard</color>, I'll buy you a drink if you answer a question.
  - I will be happy to answer you, <color=purple>young man</color>.
  - What was in <color=cyan>Bel Mont</color>?
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> laughed.
  - This is a very difficult question, my friend. What would motivate a man to fight
    an invincible enemy?
  - There are no invincible enemies.
  - You're absolutely right, there's a legendary battle where peasants defeated an
    entire army, even though they were incredibly outnumbered. The only strength
    they had was a deep desire to protect their families and their land.
  - You bards exaggerate everything, that's impossible.
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> smiled.
  - You're absolutely right,
  - But I liked this song, I'll learn to play it.
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> laughed.
  - A warrior learning to play a song where the national army is the villain, this
    is the first time I've seen it.
  - The army is the villain? I didn't even notice..
  - Great! We bards write our songs subtly so the warriors don't realize we're doing
    propaganda against them.
  - Aren't you afraid to say that in front of a warrior?
  - The <color=#00FFBF>bard</color> smiled kindly.
  - No.
