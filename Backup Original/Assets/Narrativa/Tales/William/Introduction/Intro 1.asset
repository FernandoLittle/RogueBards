  Dialogue:
  - 'In Sarka an assassin said:'
  - What is the difference between the assassin and the warrior? Is one kinder than
    the other? Is one smarter than the other? Is one more virtuous than the other?
  - No no and no. They did not trace different paths through a difference of morals,
    intellect, or virtue.
  - Even if they don't consciously realize it, humans rarely care about what's good
    and moral, what's priority for them is reputation, in other words, it's more
    important to look good than actually be.
  - A warrior is just a human who lives in a place where being a warrior is seen
    as good, an assassin is just a human who lives in a place where being an assassin
    is seen as good.
  - 'In Sarka a warrior said:'
  - Assassins talk so fucking much.
