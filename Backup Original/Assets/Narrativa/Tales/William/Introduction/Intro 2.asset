  Dialogue:
  - 'In <color=yellow>Sarka</color> an assassin said:'
  - The law that creates all the others is the law of the strongest, what assassins
    call the Guild Document and what warriors call the Federal Constitution are nothing
    more than manifestations of the will of the strong.
  - The will of the strong has no obligation to be consistent with the just and moral,
    and that's exactly what we see everywhere, rules that serve the powerful who
    create and execute the laws.
  - 'In <color=yellow>Sarka</color> a warrior said:'
  - We will give our sword and our heart to execute the law.
