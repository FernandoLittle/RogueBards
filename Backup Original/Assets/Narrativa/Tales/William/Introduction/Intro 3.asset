  Dialogue:
  - 'In <color=yellow>Sarka</color> an assassin said:'
  - Civilization has managed to turn nature into a tool over the seasons.
  - But the human being is also part of nature and so he stopped living for himself
    and became a tool.
  - When the human goes to school, works, pays his taxes and dies in the war he evolves
    as a servant of <color=yellow>Lyoko</color>.
  - The guild is the civilized world's greatest enemy, as its purpose is to kill
    all the vagabonds who try to chain others with the chains of civilization.
  - In Sarka a warrior said.
  - We will lay down our lives for law, order and the nation.
