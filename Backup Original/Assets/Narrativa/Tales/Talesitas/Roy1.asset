  Dialogue:
  - '"<color=blue>Roy</color>, our next mission is in <color=purple>Denai</color>,
    the village of the cannibals who killed the <color=blue></color>emperor"'
  - '"<color=purple>Denai</color>... <color=yellow>Yuri</color>, you have inside
    information and stuff like that, you know how the <color=red>emperor</color>
    ended up in that village?"'
  - "\u201CGood question, we have weird rumors about it, but the most reasonable
    explanation I saw was that he was taking food to the village and the bastards
    killed him.\u201D"
  - '"<i>To</i>" and "<i>from</i>" are very beautiful words.'
  - "\u201CThe emperor was not in the habit of distributing food personally, on the
    contrary\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201C<color=blue>Roy</color>! Let's respect the honor of our former leader,
    organize your troops, the day after tomorrow we'll leave, let's defeat those
    regicides cannibals!\u201D"
