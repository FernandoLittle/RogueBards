  Dialogue:
  - "\u201CYour name is <color=blue>Roy Ulbricht</color>, your duty is to keep the
    peace, your duty is to protect the weak, your duty is to fight for the nation,
    your duty is to make money.\u201D"
  - Roy repeated these virtuous words to himself over and over to inspire him to
    get out of bed. He hadn't eaten well in weeks and as much as his body wanted
    to save energy, his soul wouldn't allow it.
  - "One more time:\n\u201CYour name is <color=blue>Roy Ulbricht</color>, your duty
    is to keep the peace, your duty is to protect the weak, your duty is to fight
    for the nation, your duty is to make money.\u201D"
  - After getting up, like every good citizen of <color=green>Sarka</color>, he went
    to work. But Roy was no ordinary man, he had the noblest of jobs, he was a soldier
    of the <color=red>Blue Guard</color>.
  - Upon arriving at the barracks, he found his superior, <color=yellow>Yuri Vitchi</color>,
    a leader admired for his courage and effort. He was about to announce the task
    that would allow Roy to keep the peace, protect the weak, fight for the nation,
    and make money.
  - Their mission would be to face <color=green>Sarka</color>'s vilest creatures,
    the regicidal cannibals who lived in <color=purple>Denai</color>.
